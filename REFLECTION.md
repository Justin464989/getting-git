Throughout the whole process, I felt pretty lost espcially when\
I would run the commands at certain steps, but I would not receive\
the expected output. Thankfully, Phyu Phyu had provided screenshots\
of what she had done, which helped guide me through certain steps.\
5/2/25 update:\
After watching some videos on Git and playing around with a\
playground repo, I feel more confident with using Git and I no longer\
feel lost. The structure around how Git deals with the files and how\
changes are documented and uploaded is so much clearer to me now.\
I just had to celebrate by updating this reflection.\
